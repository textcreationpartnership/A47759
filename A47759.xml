            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="3">III. The next <hi>Hereſie</hi> of <hi>G.W</hi>'s and the <hi>Quakers,</hi> which <hi>T.E.</hi> defends, is that againſt the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in making <hi>Chriſt</hi> or the <hi>Word</hi> to have aſſum'd an Humane Body, only as a <hi>Vail</hi> or a <hi>Garment,</hi> wherein He Dwelt for a time, as <hi>Angels,</hi> when they appear'd in Bodies; but Deny (with the <hi>Socinians</hi>) that He really became a <hi>Man,</hi> by taking our <hi>Nature</hi> into His own <hi>Perſon;</hi> and therefore ſay that He had not an Humane <hi>Soul,</hi> tho' He dwelt in an Humane <hi>Body.</hi> For this <hi>G.

If the Body and Soul of the Son of God were, Both, Created, doth not this render him a Fourth Perſon?</hi> In excuſe of this, <hi>T. E.</hi> ſuppoſes that he, in anſwer to whom <hi>G. W.</hi> wrote this (one <hi>T.

As is his other Excuſe, that that coming to Judgment was not to <hi>ſave</hi> us; for the Conteſt was not for what End He came; But whether He would come or not?

               </p>
               <p n="5">V. The next Quotation out of G.

Is it Viſible or Inviſible? within us, or without us only? And is Chriſt the Saviour, as an outward Bodily Exiſtence or Perſon without us, Diſtinct from God, and on that conſideration, to be worſhipped as God, yea, or nay? And where doth the Scripture ſay, He is Outwardly and Bodily Glorify'd at God's Right hand? Do theſe terms expreſs the Glory that he had with the Father before the World began, in which He is now Glorified?</hi> In Excuſe for all this Vehement Denyal of <hi>Chriſt's BODILY</hi> Exiſtence at the Right Hand of <hi>God. T. E.</hi> ſays, p. 40. That ſometimes Queſtions are only for Information, or to amuſe an Adverſary, not to ſhew ones own Opinion. Yes, ſometimes they are ſo. And it is very Plain when they are ſo. And ſometimes they are the moſt Poſitive way of aſſerting; as implying an Aſtoniſhment or Wonder of the Contrary, as ſo manifeſt an Abſurdity, as not to be Defended. And it is as manifeſt when <hi>Queſtions</hi> are in this ſtrain. And <hi>T. E.</hi> dares not ſay, that theſe <hi>Queſtions</hi> of G. W. were not in this later ſenſe. And therefore his ſuggeſting this, was againſt his own Conſcience; and to ſhew that he was Reſolv'd to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Cauſe, <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Wrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſecond Anſwer is yet more Notorious, p. 40. He ſuppoſes that <hi>R. Gordon,</hi> G. W<hi>'s</hi> Opponent intended to Deny the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (which he never Deny'd, but Strongly aſſerts) <hi>and to ſet up the Body that was born of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59292:5"/>
the Virgin, for the only, whole, Intire Chriſt and Saviour.</hi> And that G. W. only meant to oppoſe him in this. 1ſt, The Words above quoted were a ſtrange ſort of oppoſition, if this had been ſo. But 2dly, This is as Errant a <hi>Slander</hi> as ever was Invented; and <hi>T. E.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> know it full well. For <hi>R. Gordon</hi> held no ſuch thing, nor any thing like it; No, nor any Man that ever was Born, that only the <hi>Body</hi> was <hi>Chriſt!</hi> Did that ever enter into the Head of any Creature! So Confounded, ſo Deſtitute of all appearance of Truth, are theſe <hi>Quaker</hi> Pretences, whereby, in ſtead of <hi>forſaking,</hi> they ſeek to <hi>cover</hi> and ſow <hi>Fig-leaves</hi> before their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs.</hi> They have but one Security left, That it is a ſhame to Confute them.

are Good <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> Nay, he ſeems to Prefer the <hi>Heathen,</hi> whom he calls <hi>A Child of God,</hi> in Contradiſtinction from a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> He makes nothing of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> but only an <hi>outward Character,</hi> or <hi>Diſcriminating Difference,</hi> viz. an <hi>Hiſtorical Faith of Chriſts outward Appearance in the Fleſh at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> Which indeed, if that be all, is but a very ſmall matter, a little <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> But he makes the <hi>Heathen</hi> to have <hi>The Kind and Nature of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> which he Prefers to that <hi>outward Character,</hi> or <hi>Diſcriminating Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> which do's diſtinguiſh him from the <hi>Hiſtorical Chriſtian. G. Keith</hi> had allow'd that <hi>Morality</hi> was a <hi>part</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and did <hi>belong to the</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>of a Christian.

E.</hi> he objects againſt this, and ſhews his Parts in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> as well as <hi>Divinity. And I pray</hi> (ſays he) <hi>which is of most Moment in this caſe, the</hi> Genus <hi>or the</hi> Differentia? <hi>To have the</hi> Kind <hi>and</hi> Nature <hi>of a</hi> Chriſtian, <hi>or to have only ſome</hi> outward Character, <hi>or</hi> Diſcriminating Difference, <hi>to diſtinguiſh a</hi> Chriſtian <hi>from a</hi> Child of God, <hi>as Namely an</hi> Hiſtorical <hi>Faith of Christ's outward appearance in the Fleſh at Jeruſalem?</hi> But with ſubmiſſion, I muſt correct <hi>T. E</hi>'s <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> for it is the <hi>Differentia,</hi> not the <hi>Genus</hi> which Determines the <hi>Kind</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Animal</hi> is the <hi>Genus</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> but it is <hi>Rationale</hi> which makes him of a Different <hi>Kind</hi> or <hi>Species</hi> from other <hi>Animals.</hi> And this ſets the <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia</hi> as much above the <hi>Genus,</hi> as <hi>Man</hi> is above a <hi>Beast.</hi> But by <hi>T. E</hi>'s Logick, <hi>Bucephalus</hi> is little Inferior to him, only in ſome <hi>outward Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter:</hi> For, <hi>which I pray, is of moſt Moment in this caſe, the</hi> Genus <hi>or the</hi> Differentia? <hi>Bucephalus</hi> has the <hi>Genus,</hi> and <hi>T. E.</hi> has the <hi>Differentia,</hi> and, as himſelf makes it, but a ſmall one. Therefore, tho' a <hi>Moral Heathen</hi> have the <hi>Genus</hi> of a <hi>Christian,</hi> yet he can no more be a <hi>Christian</hi> without the <hi>Differentia,</hi> than a <hi>Horſe</hi> can be <hi>T. E.</hi> And this <hi>Differentia</hi> is not only an <hi>Historical</hi> Faith in <hi>Christ's</hi> Appearance in the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> as <hi>T. E.</hi> makes it? But a Living <hi>Faith</hi> in his <hi>Blood</hi> outwardly <hi>ſhed,</hi> as the Full <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <hi>God</hi> for our Sins. And as far as any one is from this <hi>Faith,</hi> ſo far he is from <hi>Christianity.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Quakers,</hi> by Diſputing againſt and Diſowning of this <hi>Faith,</hi> inſtead of bringing the <hi>Heathen</hi> within the <hi>Pale</hi> of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> have thruſt themſelves out among the <hi>Heathen.</hi> From whom, their <hi>meerly Historical</hi> Faith in the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as <hi>T.

Keith</hi>'s <hi>Charge,</hi> which <hi>T.E</hi> begins to Anſwer, p. 103. which is, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> do Deny <hi>Juſtification and Sanctification by the Blood of Chriſt outwardly ſhed.</hi> And the firſt Proof is <hi>W. Penn,</hi> who <hi>Totally</hi> Excludes the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> His Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is from that Petition in the Lord's Prover, <hi>Forgive no our Debts, as we forgive our Debtors.</hi> From whence W.P. infers, That, <hi>if it is our Duty to forgive without a ſatisfaction received; and that God is to forgive us, as we forgive them, then is a Satisfaction Totally Excluded.</hi> But though the <hi>Debtor</hi> makes no <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> yet <hi>God</hi> has promiſed to do it, in <hi>Full Meaſure, Preſſed down, ſhaken together,</hi> and <hi>Running over,</hi> to thoſe who <hi>Forgive</hi> any thing for His ſake. So that here is <hi>Satisfaction</hi> not <hi>Totally Excluded;</hi> But <hi>Filled up,</hi> every to the Brim. But how do's <hi>T. E.</hi> Anſwer this? He ſays, p. 104, 105. That W.P. meant only to <hi>Exclude</hi> a <hi>PLENARY,</hi> or <hi>F<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LL,</hi> or <hi>RIGID</hi> (which is the ſame) <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> 1ſt.

P.</hi> neither <hi>made</hi> any ſuch Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, nor could <hi>Intend</hi> it: For his Argument runs againſt All <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> He did not mean that we were Commanded to <hi>Forgive</hi> our <hi>Debtors</hi> only in <hi>part;</hi> elſe <hi>God</hi> was to <hi>Forgive</hi> us but in <hi>part,</hi> ſince, as he ſays, <hi>God is to forgive us, as we Forgive them.</hi> And thence concludes, That <hi>A Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> i. e. <hi>Any Satisfaction</hi> is not only <hi>Excluded,</hi> but, to ſhew his Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, <hi>TOTALLY Excluded.</hi> T.

               <p n="2">II. The next Quotation is out of <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> which <hi>T E.</hi> comes to p. 109. and Repeating the <hi>Charge,</hi> That G. W. blames <hi>W. Burnet,</hi> his Opponent, for ſaying, <hi>The Blood ſhed upon the Croſs, ſprinkles the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Sanctifies, Juſtifies, Redeems us,</hi> ſays, That G. W. only Blames him for ſaying thus, as an Abſurdity following upon what <hi>W. Burnet</hi> had ſaid, That <hi>that</hi> Blood <hi>was not now in Being.</hi> Why? Do's G. W. believe that <hi>that</hi> Blood is any otherwiſe in Being, than as <hi>W. Burnet</hi> did believe? He Dare not ſay ſo. And if not, their there was no Conteſt betwixt <hi>Burnet</hi> and him, upon that Head. So that this is Plainly giving us the Go by: and all the Conſequences which G. W. draws, or pretends to draw from that ſaying of <hi>Burnet</hi>'s are fully Chargeable upon Himſelf.</p>
               <p>But 2dly, I deſire the Reader here to take Notice of the Groſſeſt piece of Deceit, that, perhaps, ever he met with: For that ſaying of <hi>Burnet</hi>'s (p. 40. of his Book) is only his Repetition of it, as being the <hi>Quakers</hi> own Objection againſt the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of that <hi>Blood</hi> which was ſhed upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> to us now, viz. That it was not now <hi>in Being,</hi> and therefore that we could not now be <hi>Juſtified</hi> by that which was not <hi>in Being.</hi> To which <hi>W. Burnet</hi> Anſwers, That <hi>though that Blood ſhed be not in Being</hi> (that is <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing,</hi> but not <hi>Granting</hi> it) <hi>yet the Efficacy of that Blood is ſtill in Being, and it ſtill ſpeaks in God's Ears, and crys aloud for Mercy. If</hi> Abel<hi>'s Blood did cry againſt the Murderer</hi> (for Vengeance) <hi>How much more louder doth the Blood of the Lamb ſlain, cry for Mercy?</hi> &amp;c. Here <hi>Burnet</hi> only gives way to this Suppoſition of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> viz. That <hi>that</hi> Blood was <hi>not in Being,</hi> by way of <hi>Conceſſion,</hi> not as his own Opinion; to ſhew that no Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence could be drawn from it, to favour the <hi>Quaker Hereſie</hi> of Denying <hi>Juſtification</hi> by that <hi>Blood.</hi> And yet <hi>T. E.</hi> (concealing of this) would put it upon Us, That G. W. in Anſwer to this Place of <hi>Burnet,</hi> did oppoſe him only for that <hi>Suppoſition;</hi> and that (agreeing Perfectly with him in <hi>Juſtification</hi> by that <hi>Blood</hi>) he only ſhew'd the Ill Conſequences of that <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> which was his own; and which he will not, no, nor <hi>T. E.</hi> or any other of their <hi>Quakers,</hi> Dare Deny at this Day, viz. That <hi>that Blood ſhed upon the Croſs, is not now in Being.</hi> This is Turning the Tables upon <hi>W. Burnet,</hi> in ſuch an Impudent Manner, that, if I had not ſeen his Book, I could not have believed it. But 3dly, If that <hi>Suppoſition</hi> had been <hi>W. Burnet</hi>'s, and not the <hi>Quakers</hi> own, it would not Reſcue G. W. becauſe he plainly makes the Concluſion his own, by Denying <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by <hi>that</hi> Blood: However, juſtly it is drawn from that ſuppoſed <hi>Suppoſition.</hi> 4thly, The <hi>Agonies</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> are not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59292:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
now <hi>in being:</hi> And this Argument of <hi>G. W</hi>'s will Diſſolve all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of His <hi>Death,</hi> to our <hi>Juſtification</hi> thereby, as well as by His <hi>Blood;</hi> for indeed they are the ſame. But 5thly, All theſe little Cavillings about the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which was ſhed either <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> His <hi>Death,</hi> are only to <hi>Amuſe:</hi> For they Deny any <hi>Juſtification</hi> by the <hi>outward Christ,</hi> upon any account. In <hi>A Serious Apology,</hi> written by <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>William Penn,</hi> printed 1671. p. 148. Repeating a Charge againſt them in theſe words. <hi>That we deny Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs which Chriſt hath fulfilled in His own Perſon for us (wholly without us) and therefore Deny the Lord who Bought us.</hi> To which <hi>W. Penn</hi> anſwers in theſe words. <hi>And indeed this we Deny, and Bodly affirm it, in the Name of the Lord, To be the Doctrine of Devils, and an Arm of the Sea of Corruption, which does now Deluge the Whole World.</hi> If they think to come off by that ſaying, <hi>wholly without us.</hi> I anſwer, that the <hi>Meritorious</hi> and only <hi>Procuring</hi> cauſe of our <hi>Juſtification</hi> is <hi>wholly without us,</hi> i. e. <hi>By the Righteouſneſs which Chriſt hath fulfilled in His own Perſon for us;</hi> and the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> which He hath made by His <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> for our <hi>Sins.</hi> But the <hi>Application</hi> of this to Particular Perſons muſt be <hi>Inward,</hi> by the Operation of His bleſſed Spirit in our <hi>Hearts.</hi> And this hinders not, but rather ſuppoſes that the <hi>Meritorious Cauſe</hi> is <hi>wholly without us,</hi> i. e. All the <hi>Merit</hi> is to be Attributed to what <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath <hi>done</hi> and <hi>ſuffer'd</hi> for us: for we can <hi>Merit</hi> nothing from <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>our ſelves.</hi> And not only to Deny this, but to call it a <hi>Doctrine of Devils,</hi> &amp;c. And that <hi>In the Name af the Lord!</hi> As it ſhews theſe Men to be utter Strangers to the true Principles of the <hi>Christian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; ſo do's it Deſerve an <hi>Animadverſion</hi> which I will ſpare in this place.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>T. E.</hi> p. 111. puts the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s Objection againſt <hi>G. W.</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Now the</hi> Quakers <hi>would be ſo far from directing Men to go to the Material Temple at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>that they make it but a vain thing to look to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to the Anti-Type of that Temple,</hi> viz. <hi>to</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>as he was there</hi> Crucified, <hi>or to that</hi> Blood <hi>that was there ſhed for Juſtification.</hi> Now ſays <hi>T. E.</hi> ſee the Anſwer which <hi>G. W.</hi> gives, thus, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>ſee no need of Directing men to the Type for the Anti-Type, nor yet to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>either to</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>or His</hi> Blood <hi>And where do the Scriptures ſay, the</hi> Blood <hi>was There ſhed for Juſtification? T. E.</hi> ſays in Excuſe, <hi>That there is a</hi> Typographical <hi>Error in this Paſſage.</hi> But do's not <hi>Infallibility</hi> reach to <hi>Writing</hi> or <hi>Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as well as <hi>Speaking?</hi> It ſeems the <hi>Quaker Infallibility</hi> do's not go <hi>throughout.</hi> But what is this <hi>Error?</hi> Why intread of <hi>The Quakers ſee no need of Directing Men to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>either To Jeſus Chriſt or His Blood,</hi> it ſhould have been <hi>Either</hi> (ſays <hi>T.

Why? was that the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s Meaning? <hi>T. E.</hi> dare not ſay that. The moſt <hi>Superſtitious</hi> that ever went thither in <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,</hi> never thought any thing ſo abſurd as that. 2dly, What is the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59292:12"/>
Difference betwixt <hi>FOR</hi> and <hi>TO</hi> in this Place? To ſend Men to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, TO</hi> look for <hi>Jeſus Christ or His Blood,</hi> or <hi>FOR</hi> to look for them? 3dly, Was this <hi>Typographical</hi> Error ever taken Notice of before? No, not a word of it, though it was Printed in the Year 1663. Were there any <hi>Errata</hi> of the <hi>Preſs</hi> Printed? Yes, a good many, at the End of the Book. Was not this among them? No. Then ſurely, it was either thought not to be an <hi>Erratum:</hi> or not ſo Material as <hi>Traſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation</hi> for <hi>Tranſmutation,</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>Literal</hi> Erratas, which are there carefully Printed. And Trumping it up Now, ſhews the <hi>weak Efforts</hi> of a <hi>Dying Cauſe;</hi> like a <hi>Drowning Man</hi> catching at a <hi>Straw;</hi> which yet do's not ſave him: For, as before ſaid, this <hi>Typographical</hi> Error (ſuppoſing it to be one) do's no ſervice at all to his Cauſe, but leaves him juſt where it found him: But what ſays he to that Expreſſion above quoted, <hi>Where do the Scriptures ſay, the Blood was there ſhed for Juſtification?</hi> This is a Crabbed Place. And though <hi>T. E.</hi> Repeats it again, p. 112. Yet he ſays not one Word in excuſe for it. But <hi>G. W.</hi> lets us ſee his Opinion fully in the ſame Book here quoted by <hi>T. E.</hi> viz. <hi>The Light and Life of Christ within,</hi> Printed 1668. p. 51. where he makes a Dialogue betwixt the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> he Diſputes againſt, and himſelf. Thus. <hi>I ask</hi> (ſays <hi>G. W.) who is He that ſatisfies and appeaſeth God, Diſchargeth the Guilty, and Pays the Debt?</hi> Bapt. <hi>It is the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> G. W. <hi>Whence came He?</hi> Bapt. <hi>God gave Him.</hi> G. W. <hi>And what is this Man Chriſt Jeſus, who can Satisfie, Pacifie an Infinit God?</hi> Bapt. <hi>He is God-Man, born of a Virgin.</hi> G. W. <hi>How would this Divide God, and ſet Him at Diſtance from Himſelf? Is it good Doctrine to ſay, That God Pacified God when He ſaw Himſelf angry? For ſays the Baptist,</hi> It was God Man that did it. <hi>Which is all one as to ſay, God Corrected Himſelf—and then He was Mediator to Himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>G. W.</hi> Blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly (with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and in their very words) Ridicules the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and our <hi>Juſtification</hi> by it: and ſhews his utter Ignorance of the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine. Which I ſtay not now to Diſpute: My Buſineſs being only to Detect theſe Men, That they have Groſly Miſtaken it.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed, I find my ſelf oblig'd to ask <hi>T. E</hi>'s Pardon. For that I ſaid juſt now, while I was conſidering his page 111. That he Durſt not ſay, That the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>'s meaning (againſt whom he Diſputes) was to ſend Men <hi>now</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to look for the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> which was ſhed <hi>There</hi> 1600 Years ago, as if it were <hi>now</hi> to be found there. And indeed I thought ſo, That neither <hi>T. E.</hi> or any Man whatever Durſt have ventur'd upon a Suppoſition ſo Monſtrouſly Abſurd: But, to my great ſurprize, I find, reading, p. 115. That he <hi>Poſitively,</hi> and without any <hi>Haeſitation</hi> aſſerts it. That the <hi>Baptist</hi> did <hi>Direct People</hi> now <hi>to go Thither</hi> (Jeruſalem) <hi>for it</hi> (the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> there ſhed) <hi>or Look thither for it, as if it were</hi> now <hi>to be found there.</hi> Theſe are his Words. I will not take up the Reader's time to vindicate this <hi>Baptist, (W. Burnet)</hi> whom <hi>T. E.</hi> thus accuſes; but Refer
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59292:12"/>
to his Book, Intituled, <hi>The Captital Errors of the People called Quakers,</hi> Printed 1668. In Anſwer to which <hi>G. W.</hi> wrote <hi>The Light and Life,</hi> &amp;c. above quoted. And it will there appear, not only that <hi>W. Burnet</hi> had no ſuch groſs conceit: but that he Plainly and <hi>Fully</hi> Expreſſes himſelf to the Contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was the <hi>Merit</hi> of <hi>Christ's Blood,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Redemption</hi> thereby wrought, that he contended for: and not that the Material <hi>Blood</hi> which was ſhed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was <hi>Now</hi> there to be found. But the <hi>Quakers</hi> oppoſe the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine: and (when pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) think to Blind the Eyes of the World, by Pretending that they only ſpoke againſt ſuch Opinions, as never were held; and which their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers Deteſt as much as they can do.

               <p n="4">IV. The next Quotation objected by <hi>G.

W. ſets down, viz. <hi>That the Righteouſneſs which God works in us, is but Finite, as well as other Effects.</hi> This G.

But he not only ſays that it is <hi>Infinit,</hi> but goes on to Prove it. <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Chriſt is Gods Righteouſneſs; and Chriſt is formed in us,</hi> Gal. iv. 19. Thus miſerably Perverting the Scripture. But they are Deſir'd to tell us, how <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity</hi> can be <hi>Formed?</hi> 2dly, How formed in that which is <hi>Finit?</hi> G.

of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of the <hi>Saints</hi> to be the ſame; and corrupts that Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 11. to Prove it, which he Repeats thus, <hi>He that Sanctifieth, and they that are Sanctified, are one.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Text</hi> is, <hi>are all of one</hi>

That an <hi>Earthly</hi> Body, Changed into an <hi>Heavenly</hi> Body, may be the ſame <hi>Body,</hi> it is True: But that it ſhould be the ſame <hi>Earthly</hi> Body, none ever ſaid. It is a Contradiction, it is to ſay that it is <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> and not <hi>Changed.</hi> But <hi>how is it poſſible</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Penn,</hi> ibid.) <hi>that it ſhould be the ſame, and not the ſame?</hi> Very eaſily. Is Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> the <hi>ſame Man,</hi> as before he turn'd <hi>Quaker?</hi> No ſure. There is a Great <hi>Change</hi> wrought in him. Yet it is the <hi>ſame W. Penn;</hi> or elſe He never <hi>Changed.</hi> But, ſays he, in his <hi>Reaſon againſt Railing,</hi> p. 134. <hi>If a thing can yet be the ſame, and notwithſtanding</hi> Changed; <hi>for ſhame let us never make ſo much ſtir againſt the Doctrine of</hi> Tranſ-ſubſtantiation; <hi>for the Abſurdity of it, is rather out-done, than Equal'd by this Carnal Reſurrection.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> is ſo far out in his Reaſoning here, That a thing being <hi>Changed</hi> ſhews it to be the <hi>ſame.</hi> If you <hi>Dye</hi> one piece of Cloth, it is no <hi>change,</hi> in another piece of Cloth: And it were no <hi>change</hi> in the <hi>Cloth,</hi> if it was not the <hi>ſame</hi> Cloth that was <hi>changed.</hi> And if <hi>Mr Penn</hi> thinks <hi>Tranſ-ſubſtantiation</hi> a Leſs <hi>Abſurdity</hi> than this, we may yet ſee another <hi>change</hi> in him. But, to return to <hi>T. E.</hi> Notwithſtanding of all that can be ſaid or Done, he ſtill holds to it, That we believe no <hi>Change</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> in the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and puts it upon <hi>G. Keith,</hi> p. 143. <hi>So that it ſeems</hi> (ſays he) <hi>according to</hi> G. Keith, <hi>it must be a Terreſtrial Elementary Body, after it is Re-united to the Soul in Heaven.</hi> Though <hi>G. Keith</hi> has not only ſaid, but Argu'd to the Contrary, even as quoted, in the ſame place, by <hi>T. E.</hi> Therefore we ſee he is Reſolv'd. He will not Badge an Ace! It muſt and ſhall be ſo! For otherwiſe, the <hi>Quakers</hi> are Undone: Becauſe if this be not the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> which they oppoſe; then there is nothing left, but that they down-right oppoſe that Doctrine of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> which has been all along Receiv'd in the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> and makes one of the <hi>Articles</hi> in her <hi>Creed.</hi> But this will yet further appear in the ſecond Point, <hi>viZ.</hi> That <hi>T. E.</hi> has not only <hi>Negatively,</hi> as in the firſt Point; but even <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> and in Plain Terms, Deny'd the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> in this his ſeeming Vindication of it. By the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> as ever Underſtood in the <hi>Church,</hi> is Meant the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> Body which Dyed. It is not otherwiſe a <hi>Re-ſurrection,</hi> i. e. a <hi>Riſing again.</hi> For that cannot <hi>Riſe</hi> which never <hi>Lay down:</hi> and that which was not <hi>Before,</hi> cannot be <hi>Again.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> will ſometimes ſay, as <hi>T. E.</hi> p. 151. that there is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59292:17"/>
a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and that of <hi>Bodies:</hi> and that there is an <hi>Heavenly Body:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are Expreſs words of <hi>Scripture.</hi> But they Deny the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of our <hi>Dead Bodies:</hi> Or that ever they will be made <hi>Heavenly Bodies.</hi> What they Mean by a <hi>Heavenly Body,</hi> themſelves, nor all the World can tell. One of their <hi>She-Preachers</hi> told a Friend of mine, That it was the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> But that they Deny the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>ſame Body</hi> which <hi>Dyed,</hi> T. E. makes very Evident, p. 149. where he Diſputes, That the <hi>Natural</hi> and the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Body are <hi>Two</hi> Diſtinct Bodies; and not the <hi>ſame Body,</hi> in Different <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Qualifications.</hi> Thus he Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 44. <hi>He does not ſay, The Natural is made a Spiritual Body; or the Natural Body and the Spiritual Body is but one and the ſame Body: but he ſets them in oppoſition, as Two Diſtinct Bodies.</hi> And <hi>The Body</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that is put into the Grave, is a Natural Body: but the Body that is Raiſed, is a Spiritual Body — and that none might think this Spiritual Body was the ſame, he adds, There is a Natural Body, and there is a Spiritual Body.</hi> Thus <hi>T. E.</hi> underſtands that <hi>Scripture,</hi> and goes on to Prove it further by the Compariſon of the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>ſecond Adam;</hi> and ſays that the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Natural Body,</hi> are no more the ſame Body, than the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> are the ſame Man, i. e. than <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> are the ſame.</p>
               <p>And to ſhew their utter Ignorance of the Doctrine of the <hi>Reſurrection, T. E.</hi> p. 140. &amp;c. quotes <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and <hi>G.

But why not upon that <hi>Body</hi> it had before, as well as upon a <hi>New</hi> Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For let me ask theſe <hi>Quakers,</hi> who ſay that the <hi>Soul</hi> will have a <hi>Body</hi> in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> tho' not the ſame <hi>body</hi> it had before: will that New <hi>Body</hi> be any <hi>Addition</hi> of <hi>Happineſs,</hi> or <hi>Advantage</hi> to the <hi>Soul?</hi> If not. To what Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is it? But if ſo, then is the <hi>Soul</hi> in an <hi>Imperfect</hi> State before it gets that Body: and all the <hi>Quaker</hi> Objections Return upon themſelves. Let them then ſpeak out, and own the True <hi>Quaker</hi> Opinion, <hi>viZ.</hi> That the <hi>Soul</hi> do's Receive that <hi>Heavenly Body</hi> Immediately after <hi>Death.</hi> Nay, I have heard ſome ſay, That they had it already; and all the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> that ever they expect. Indeed, they know not what they mean by it: and that <hi>Heavenly Body</hi> which they talk of, moſt of them underſtand nothing by it, but the <hi>Soul</hi> it ſelf; or an <hi>Heavenly Frame</hi> or <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of the <hi>Soul:</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:59292:17"/>
which they think they have attain'd already; or, may be, ſome of them may think, they may have it in an Higher Meaſure, after their Death. And this is all the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and all the <hi>Heavenly Body,</hi> that they Mean, when they uſe theſe Words.</p>

But <hi>T. E's</hi> Inference is not Good, That becauſe <hi>Chriſt's Body</hi> had <hi>more Divinity</hi> in it than other Mens, that therefore <hi>it was too Heavenly to he call'd Humane or Earthly.</hi> For the <hi>Hypoſtatical</hi> or <hi>Perſonal</hi> Union of his <hi>Human</hi> with his <hi>Divine</hi> Nature, did not <hi>Deſtroy</hi> or <hi>Swallow up</hi> his <hi>Humanity,</hi> as the <hi>Eutychians</hi> held; But his <hi>Human</hi> both <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> are ſtill, and for ever, Truly and Properly <hi>Humane,</hi> elſe he were not Truly and Properly a <hi>Man.</hi> And the not knowing of this has greatly Milled the <hi>Quakers:</hi> Who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they had given themſelves, but a little, to <hi>Humane Learning</hi> (which they deſpis'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had it not) and had known the Ancient <hi>Hereſies</hi> which were Condemned by the Church, in ſeveral Ages; they wou'd not have fallen in with ſo many of them, as they have Ignorantly done. <hi>T.

               <p>And now ſince <hi>T.

               <p>But 2dly, This, if it could be prov'd, would not do their buſineſs; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>T. E.</hi> has here confin'd the Notion of the <hi>Church</hi> to a <hi>gather'd Body</hi> of <hi>People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then either there was ſuch a <hi>Gather'd Body</hi> before <hi>G.

               <p>If they think to <hi>Retort</hi> (which is no <hi>Anſwer</hi>), That this is like the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Papiſts do ask at us, <hi>Where was your Church before</hi> LU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is not, where THE <hi>Church</hi> was? And if the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were loſt, as the <hi>Seven</hi> Famous <hi>Churches</hi> to whom St. <hi>John</hi> wrote in the <hi>Revelations</hi> (and ſhe has no more Promiſe than they), yet THE <hi>Church</hi> is not loſt, of which ſhe is but One Member: And All the above-nam'd <hi>Epiſcopal Churches,</hi> who never ſubmitted to the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> are abundantly ſufficient to Repel that Frivolous Objection of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as if there had been no Church of Chriſt before <hi>Luther,</hi> except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who make <hi>Themſelves Only</hi> to be THE <hi>Church,</hi> this is an Invincible Argument: And they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to ſtruggle from under it.</p>
               <p>And it is to be obſerv'd how the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Quakers</hi> are alike invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by this Contradictory Pretence of ſetting up a <hi>Particular</hi> for the <hi>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal</hi> Church. Chriſt has promiſed to his <hi>Church,</hi> That it ſhould never <hi>fail,</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> from the <hi>Faith,</hi> i. e. He will always preſerve ſuch a <hi>Church</hi> ſomewhere or other: But the Promiſe is to no <hi>Particular Church.</hi> Now when a <hi>Particular Church</hi> arrogates to its ſelf the Title of THE <hi>Church,</hi> it is conſequential to this, That ſhe ſhould ſet up for <hi>Infallibility</hi> too:

VVhich <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Quakers ONLY</hi> have done (and it obſtructs <hi>Both,</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from their <hi>Errors</hi>) who <hi>ONLY</hi> have aſſum'd that <hi>Preſumptuous Title:</hi> Which whoever does, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> ſaid, is a <hi>Lucifer</hi> for <hi>Pride,</hi> and the <hi>Fore-runner of Antichriſt.</hi> This the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Quakers</hi> have to divide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves.

he himſelf is within the</hi> Vail, <hi>which is the</hi> Holy of Holies, <hi>whereunto Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our High Prieſt hath entered,</hi> Heb. X. 20, 21.

Nor do I well underſtand the meaning of Chriſt's entring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his own <hi>Fleſh,</hi> which is the <hi>Vail;</hi> and then within himſelf, which is <hi>the Holy of Holies.</hi> It ſeems to bear this meaning, that as the High Prieſt, having enter'd through the <hi>Vail,</hi> left it behind him; ſo that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath left his <hi>Body</hi> behind him, having paſſed through it, into the <hi>Holy of Holies.</hi> Which <hi>G. Keith</hi> ſays, one <hi>Robert Young,</hi> a Preacher among the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Penſilvania, Did aſſert, and brought theſe very words of</hi> W. P. <hi>to Confirm it.</hi> Which <hi>T. E. p.</hi> 215. Does not deny, but ſays, there ought to be ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Voucher beſides <hi>G.

P.</hi> and <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> who did not deny, either the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> or the <hi>Inward Influence</hi> of his <hi>Bleſſed Spirit</hi> in our <hi>Hearts.</hi> Yet <hi>T. E.</hi> gives this Excuſe for theſe words of <hi>W.

               </p>
               <p>This makes the matter look much worſe againſt <hi>W. P.</hi> than any thing <hi>G. Keith</hi> hath ſaid. For it is certain that <hi>J.

And therefore it was againſt ſomething elſe, which <hi>W. P.</hi> diſputed againſt ſomething where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>J.
